The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n    most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n    For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n    can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n    The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n    discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n    Shimmed features:\n\n    * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n    element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n    reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n    document level stylesheet.\n    For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n      :host {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n      .foo {\n        background: red;\n      }\n\n    * encapsulation: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n    dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n    this feature.\n\n    By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n    as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n    of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n    div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n    x-foo div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n\n    Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n    selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n    simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n    in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n    Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n    For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n      div {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    becomes:\n\n      div[x-foo] {\n        font-weight: bold;\n      }\n\n    Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n    selector added to them manually.\n\n    * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n    shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n    inside a shadowRoot.\n\n    This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n    were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n    every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n    (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n    As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n    specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n    * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n    to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n    of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n    extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n    via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n      <style>\n        ::content(div) {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      </style>\n      <content></content>\n\n    could become:\n\n      <style>\n        / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n        ::content(div) {\n          background: red;\n        }\n      </style>\n      <div class=\"content-container\">\n        <content></content>\n      </div>\n\n    Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n    declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n    in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n  */\n  var ShadowCss = (function () {\n      function ShadowCss() {\n          this.strictStyling = true;\n      }\n      /*\n      * Shim some cssText with the given selector.

Each property can be prefixed\n   * by a special character designating its type:\n   *\n   * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n   * - `*`: property represents an event.\n   * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n   * - `#`: property is a number.\n   * - `%`: property is an object.\n   *\n   * ## Query\n   *\n   * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n   * if a given property exist on a given element.\n   *\n   * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n   * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n   *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n   */\n  // =================================================================================================\n  // =================================================================================================\n  // =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n  // =================================================================================================\n  // =================================================================================================\n  //\n  //                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n  //\n  // Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n  // dom_security_schema.ts.

In other words, if a transition is\n     * defined that\n     * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n     *\n     * ```typescript\n     * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n     * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n     *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n     *   // animation has fully completed itself\n     *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n     *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n     *\n     *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n     *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n     *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n     *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n     *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n     *\n     *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n     *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n     *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *     animate(500)\n     *   ]),\n     *\n     *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n     *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n     * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n     *\n     * ```html\n     * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n     * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * #### The final `animate` call\n     *\n     * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n     * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n     * animation\n     * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n     * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n     * applied state to be presented correctly.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n     * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n     * transition(\"void => *\", [\n     *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n     *   animate(500)\n     * ])\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n     *\n     * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n     */\n    function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n        var animationData = isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) :\n            steps;\n        return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n    }\n    /**\n     * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n     * animation\n     * DSL language.

This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n     * controls\n     * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n     * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n     * as user input.\n     *\n     * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n     * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n     * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n     * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n     * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n     * be avoided if possible.\n     *\n     * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n     * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n     * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n     *\n     * ### Syntax\n     *\n     * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     *\n     * With `<template>` element:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n     *   <li>...</li>\n     * </template>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n     * example.\n     *\n     * @stable\n     */\n    var NgFor = (function () {\n        function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n            this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n            this._template = _template;\n            this._differs = _differs;\n            this._cdr = _cdr;\n            this._differ = null;\n        }\n        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n            set: function (value) {\n                if (value) {\n                    this._template = value;\n                }\n            },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n                // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n                var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n                if (!this._differ && value) {\n                    try {\n                        this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                    }\n                    catch (e) {\n                        throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

app.\n     *\n     * @howToUse\n     *\n     * Consider the following route configuration:\n\n     * ```\n     * [{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]\n     * ```\n     *\n     * When linking to this `user/:name` route, you can write:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a routerLink='/user/bob'>link to user component</a>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * @description\n     *\n     * The RouterLink directives let you link to specific parts of your app.\n     *\n     * Whe the link is static, you can use the directive as follows:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a routerLink=\"/user/bob\">link to user component</a>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * If you use dynamic values to generate the link, you can pass an array of path\n     * segments, followed by the params for each segment.\n     *\n     * For instance `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`\n     * means that we want to generate a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.\n     *\n     * Multiple static segments can be merged into one (e.g., `['/team/11/user', userName, {details:\n     true}]`).\n     *\n     * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`:\n     * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router will look up the route from the root of the\n     app.\n     * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router will\n     * instead look in the children of the current activated route.\n     * * And if the first segment begins with `../`, the router will go up one level.\n     *\n     * You can set query params and fragment as follows:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [queryParams]=\"{debug: true}\" fragment=\"education\">link to user\n     component</a>\n     * ```\n     * RouterLink will use these to generate this link: `/user/bob#education?debug=true`.\n     *\n     * You can also tell the directive to preserve the current query params and fragment:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" preserveQueryParams preserveFragment>link to user\n     component</a>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.\n     *\n     * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n     *\n     * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` will generate the link\n     * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n     *\n     * @selector ':not(a)[routerLink]'\n     * @ngModule RouterModule\n     *\n     * See {@link Router.createUrlTree} for more information.\n     *\n
